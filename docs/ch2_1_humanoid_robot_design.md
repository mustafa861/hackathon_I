# Chapter 2.1: Humanoid Robot Design

Humanoid robot design involves creating mechanical systems that mimic human form and functionality while achieving specific tasks.

## Design Principles

### Anthropomorphic Design
- Human-like proportions
- Biologically inspired structures
- Mimicking human movement patterns

### Degrees of Freedom
- Joint configurations
- Range of motion requirements
- Actuator placement

### Structural Components
- Head and neck design
- Torso and spine
- Arms and hands
- Legs and feet

## Mechanical Systems

### Actuation
- Servo motors for precise control
- Series elastic actuators
- Pneumatic artificial muscles

### Transmission Systems
- Gear ratios
- Harmonic drives
- Belt and cable systems

### Materials
- Lightweight yet strong materials
- Carbon fiber and composites
- Aluminum and titanium components

## Design Challenges

- Weight distribution
- Power consumption
- Heat dissipation
- Structural integrity
