# Chapter 2.2: Locomotion and Balance

Locomotion and balance are fundamental capabilities for humanoid robots, enabling them to move and maintain stability in various environments.

## Balance Control

### Center of Mass Management
- Real-time CoM tracking
- Zero Moment Point (ZMP) control
- Capture Point theory

### Postural Control
- Joint stiffness control
- Feedback control systems
- Perturbation response

## Walking Patterns

### Bipedal Gait
- Walking phases
- Swing and stance legs
- Ground reaction forces

### Walking Controllers
- Inverted pendulum models
- Cart-Table model
- Linear inverted pendulum

## Locomotion Strategies

### Static vs Dynamic Walking
- Static stability conditions
- Dynamic walking principles
- Trade-offs between stability and efficiency

### Terrain Adaptation
- Uneven ground navigation
- Stair climbing
- Obstacle avoidance

## Advanced Techniques

### Whole-Body Control
- Coordinated joint control
- Contact force distribution
- Multi-task optimization

### Disturbance Recovery
- Push recovery strategies
- Step adjustment algorithms
- Fall prevention
