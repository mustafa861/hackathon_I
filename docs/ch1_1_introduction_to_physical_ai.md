# Chapter 1.1: Introduction to Physical AI

Physical AI represents the intersection of artificial intelligence and the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital domains, Physical AI systems must interact with, understand, and manipulate real-world objects and environments.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI encompasses AI systems that:
- Interact directly with the physical world
- Process sensory information from real-world sensors
- Control physical actuators and mechanisms
- Navigate and operate in three-dimensional spaces
- Handle uncertainty and noise inherent in physical systems

## Key Challenges

The primary challenges in Physical AI include:
- Real-time processing requirements
- Sensor noise and uncertainty
- Physical constraints and limitations
- Safety and reliability considerations
- Integration of multiple physical systems

## Applications

Physical AI powers:
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial robots
- Service robots
- Medical robotics
- Agricultural automation
