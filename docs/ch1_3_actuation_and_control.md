# Chapter 1.3: Actuation and Control

Actuation and control systems enable Physical AI systems to interact with the physical world through precise movement and manipulation.

## Types of Actuators

### Electric Motors
- DC motors for basic motion
- Servo motors for precise positioning
- Stepper motors for discrete control

### Hydraulic and Pneumatic Systems
- High force applications
- Smooth motion control
- Industrial automation

### Linear Actuators
- Precise linear motion
- Position control
- Force control

## Control Systems

### Feedback Control
- PID controllers for stable control
- Sensor feedback integration
- Error correction mechanisms

### Motion Planning
- Path planning algorithms
- Trajectory generation
- Obstacle avoidance

### Force Control
- Compliance control
- Impedance control
- Contact force regulation

## Control Challenges

- Non-linear system dynamics
- Model uncertainty
- External disturbances
- Safety and stability
