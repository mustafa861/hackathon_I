# Chapter 1.2: Sensing and Perception

Sensing and perception form the foundation of Physical AI systems. These systems must accurately interpret sensory data to understand and interact with their environment.

## Types of Sensors

Physical AI systems utilize various types of sensors:

### Vision Sensors
- Cameras for visual perception
- Depth sensors for 3D understanding
- Thermal cameras for heat detection

### Tactile Sensors
- Force/torque sensors
- Tactile skin arrays
- Pressure sensors

### Proprioceptive Sensors
- Accelerometers
- Gyroscopes
- Encoders for joint positions

## Perception Algorithms

### Object Detection and Recognition
- Deep learning models for object identification
- Feature extraction techniques
- Scene understanding algorithms

### Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- Building maps while localizing
- Visual and LiDAR SLAM
- Loop closure detection

## Challenges in Perception

- Sensor noise and calibration
- Real-time processing requirements
- Handling occlusions
- Dynamic environments
